If the file is empty or contains no lines after stripping, handle this gracefully. Finally, the function should return a string formatted as `Min = '{shortest_line}', max = '{longest_line}'`."

        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The `min_max_line` Python function was successfully defined to accept a `filename` as an argument.\n",
        "*   The function correctly opens the specified file, reads its lines, and removes leading/trailing whitespace (including newlines) from each line using the `.strip()` method.\n",
        "*   Robust error handling was implemented for `FileNotFoundError`, and the function gracefully handles cases where the file is empty or contains only blank lines after stripping, returning `Min = '', max = ''` as required.\n",
        "*   The shortest and longest lines from the processed list of lines are accurately identified using the `min()` and `max()` functions with `key=len`.\n",
        "*   The final output string is formatted precisely as `Min = '{shortest_line}', max = '{longest_line}'`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The function is fully implemented and robust for the defined scope. No immediate next steps are required based on the current problem statement.\n",
        "*   For future enhancements, consider adding support for different file encodings or providing more specific error messages for various file access issues.\n"
